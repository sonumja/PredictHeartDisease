# PredictHeartDisease
Predict Heart Disease using UCI data set

Project: Use Artificial Neural Networks to help predict heart disease. Here is the dataset - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

Attribute Information:
Bleow 14 attributes used: 
1. #3 (age) 
2. #4 (sex) 
3. #9 (cp) 
4. #10 (trestbps) 
5. #12 (chol) 
6. #16 (fbs) 
7. #19 (restecg) 
8. #32 (thalach) 
9. #38 (exang) 
10. #40 (oldpeak) 
11. #41 (slope) 
12. #44 (ca) 
13. #51 (thal) 
14. #58 (num) (the predicted attribute)

Acuracy of the ANN model was determined and parameters were fine tuned using optimizer.
